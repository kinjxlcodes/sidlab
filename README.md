## CORS Issue

During the deployment process, we encountered a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue. This issue typically arises when the front-end application attempts to access resources (such as APIs or assets) from a different origin (domain, protocol, or port). 

The CORS issue prevented the application from accessing necessary resources, leading to deployment failure. To resolve this, ensure that the server hosting the resources has appropriate CORS headers set to allow requests from your applicationâ€™s domain.
